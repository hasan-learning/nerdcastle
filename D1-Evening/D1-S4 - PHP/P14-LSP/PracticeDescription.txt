---------- Apply LSP--------------

Look into the following two lines in Main method:

LoanAccount ln1 = new LoanAccount();
ln1.Withdraw(1000); // very harmful

A loan has no withdraw facility, but our code
offer this method for loan. 

This code violates LSP. Now, update your code so that
it will conform LSP.
